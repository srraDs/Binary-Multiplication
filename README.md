# Binary Multiplication Simulator                                                     CSARCH2 Project 2 

This project as what was assigned to Group 6 of CSArch2 is an interactive website for simulating signed binary multiplication using three different methods: 


(Accending sequence is according to modules.)

**Pencil-and-paper method**

**Booth's algorithm**

**Extended Booth's algorithm**



The sole purpose of the development of this website is a major course output in CSARCH2. The summary of this project is:

Markup : ***User can input both in decimal and binary number, that is up to a maximum of 16 bits.***

Markup : ***User can have options of having the answers already or to have it step by step.***
