# Binary Multiplication Simulator                                                     CSARCH2 Project 2 

This project as what was assigned to Group 6 of CSArch2 is an interactive website for simulating signed binary multiplication using three different methods: 


(Accending sequence, according to modules.)

- **Pencil-and-paper method**

- **Booth's algorithm**

- **Extended Booth's algorithm**



The sole purpose of the development of this website is a major course output in CSARCH2. The summary of this project is:

 - User can input both in decimal and binary number, that is up to a maximum of 16 bits.

 - User can have options of having the answers already or to have it step by step.
 
 - Users can opt to switch methods according to their needs.

 - Exporting of the demonstration to a text file.
